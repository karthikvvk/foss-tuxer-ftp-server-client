This application combines two main functionalities:

Ease of Use for Complex Software: Our app simplifies the use of powerful software that is typically limited to command-line interfaces (CLI). By providing a graphical user interface (GUI) and information highlights (ℹ️ icon), we describe various parameters and features, making it more accessible.

Quick Launch Interface: We have implemented a quick launch interface that instantly hosts an FTP server based on inputs such as:

Remote availability/local only
SSH/TLS/SSL connection
User type and rights
All these parameters are predefined, so no configuration is needed. With just one click, you can host an FTP server locally on your home machine.

Key Features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The app uses Streamlit to provide a user-friendly GUI, making it easier to interact with complex software.
Information Highlights: Each parameter or feature is accompanied by an information icon (ℹ️) that provides detailed descriptions, helping users understand their options.
Quick Launch Setup: A single-click setup for VSFTPD (Very Secure FTP Daemon) that configures and starts the FTP server with predefined settings.
Predefined Parameters: The app comes with predefined parameters for various configurations, eliminating the need for manual setup.
Local Hosting: The FTP server can be hosted locally on your home machine with just one click.

Usage:
VSFTPD Quick Setup:

The app displays a title and a button to start the quick setup.
When the button is clicked, the quiclaunch() function is executed, which sets up VSFTPD step by step automatically.
Server Configuration Panel:

The app provides a comprehensive server configuration panel where users can configure network settings, SSH settings, FTP server settings, and more.
Each setting is accompanied by an information icon (ℹ️) that provides detailed descriptions.
Server Control Panel:

Users can start, stop, or restart the server using the control panel.
The control panel provides real-time feedback on the server status.

This project aims to make powerful software more accessible by providing a user-friendly interface and simplifying the setup process.
